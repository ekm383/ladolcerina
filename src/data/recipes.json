      "Bone-in steaks are wonderful for broiling and grilling. 1-inch boneless top loin steaks (which is the larger side of the t-bone and porterhouse) are a superb choice. This steakhouse favorite has many names like sirloin, short loin, NY strip, Delmonico, strip steak etc., and loved by cooks and chefs alike for its marbling and incredible meaty, beefy flavor.",
      "Steaks from the rib (ribeyes are juicy, fatty, and fantastic), loin, and tenderloin are also excellent choices. Steaks from the chuck and round can also be excellent, but requires some knowledge in choosing the right cuts.",
      "Filet mignon, 1 ½ inch center cut beef tenderloin steaks take about 4-5 minutes per side and in a category of their own. This cut is leaner and less fatty, thus less flavorful, but famous for its supreme velvety tenderness. Tenderloin steaks benefit from not only flavored butters, but especially luscious sauces."
