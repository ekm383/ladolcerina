      "Tip: In order to get a nice sear on your meat and ensure that the meat doesn’t stick, make sure your grill is very hot. When you place the meat on the grill, you should hear it start to sizzle immediately. Let the meat cook for a few minutes without moving it. For even more surface caramelization, rotate the meat by 90 degrees and cook a few more minutes. Turn the meat over and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes depending on the size of the meat. Use the touch method to test for doneness. If the meat is still soft to the touch, it is rare. When you start to see the juices run to the surface of the meat, it is cooked to about medium. As the meat firms up, it moves closer to being well-done.",
      "Tip: Grab a few extra things while you’re out shopping like some eggplants, zucchini, and peppers. Slice them up, drizzle with a bit of olive oil, and grill for a few minutes on each side. Sprinkle with Maldon sea salt or whip up a feta spread with mint, garlic, lemon, and olives and serve everything alongside your grilled meat. It’s beautiful, healthy and delicious eating at its best!"

When you can find superbly fresh pasture raised quality ground lamb like this, you want to treat it with the love it deserves. You won’t believe the flavors you’ll be able to create when using farm fresh ingredients. Less is more, simple is best, and straight from the source is downright fabulous. This particular recipe was inspired by the flavors of Marguez - a  North African lamb sausage that just might be one of the tastiest sausages on the planet. We simplified things by applying some of the same great spicy flavors to the everyday meatball. Then we topped everything off with a lovely contrast of cucumber, yogurt, mint, and pomegranate.
