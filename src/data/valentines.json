      "In a large saucepan, or dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions, salt, and pepper and cover the pot with a lid, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Slowly cook down the onions, stirring frequently, about 45 minutes, or until very soft. The onions should melt in your mouth. ",
      "Turn up the heat and cook uncovered, stirring frequently for 5-10 minutes, until the onions are golden-brown and caramelized. Add the garlic, cook for one additional minute, then pour in the white wine and stock. Gently simmer for  20 minutes. Then stir in the sherry and simmer for an additional 10 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste.",
      "Note: The soup should taste slightly under-salted. The addition of Parmesan and Gruyère will make it saltier while the lemon juice will balance everything out with a touch of acidity. ",
      "Combine 2 teaspoons of arrowroot with a spoonful of broth from the pot in a small bowl and whisk until combined. Slowly whisk the slurry into the soup and simmer ever-so-gently, for 2 minutes, until thickened. ",
      "Note: Since we want this broth to have some body to it, we incorporated arrowroot, our favorite gluten-free thickener, to create that luscious mouthfeel we all know and love from a well-made French onion soup. ",
      "Just before serving, preheat the broiler and move the top oven rack to the middle position. Place 6 oven-proof soup bowls on a baking sheet and divide the soup evenly. Sprinkle each bowl with Parmesan and Gruyère cheese and place under the broiler until golden and bubbly. Serve immediately."

For a more refined presentation, strain the liquid into a saucepan, pressing on the solids with a ladle to extract the juices. For a more rustic presentation, serve the sauce as is, with the vegetables. ",

      "If the sauce looks thin or watery, reduce it over medium-high heat until thickened. Season the sauce with lemon juice and butter and finish it off by adding up to a tablespoon of cocoa powder, one teaspoon at a time, and tasting along the way, to balance the sweetness of the port. Add more salt and pepper as necessary.  Baste the ribs with the sauce. ",
